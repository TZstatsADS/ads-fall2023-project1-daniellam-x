### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)

This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester.

Term: Fall 2023

-   Project title: Who is Happier?

-   This project is conducted by Daniel Lam

-   Project summary: This project utilizes sentiment analysis to gain insights into how happy some of the entries in the HappyDB database are. Specifically, I compare sentiment scores across the binary features of marital, parenthood, and gender. I then look at how the sentiment scores of the entries correlate with the ages of the authors. The findings of the analysis suggest that those that are married, have kids, or are female generally express a more positive sentiment in their entries. The analysis also finds that there is a correlation in the variance of the sentiment scores with age.
